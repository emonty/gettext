Version 0.13-pre1 - November 2003

* On those few platforms (NetBSD and Woe32) for which the native
  printf()/fprintf()/... functions don't support POSIX/XSI format strings
  with positions, replacements are provided through <libintl.h>.

* New function library:
    gettext.sh - shell functions for internationalized shell scripts
* New program:
    envsubst - substitutes environment variables in shell format strings

Version 0.12 - May 2003

* A new C++ class, called gnu::autosprintf, makes it possible to use C format
  strings in C++. This is needed for proper internationalization of C++
  programs.
