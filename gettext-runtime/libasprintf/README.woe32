Installation on Woe32 (WinNT/2000/XP, Win95/98/ME):

- Requires MS Visual C/C++ 4.0 or 5.0 or 6.0 or 7.0.

- Cannot build in a separate directory.

- Build instructions:

   Make sure that the MSVC4.0 or MSVC5.0 or MSVC6.0 utilities ("cl" etc.) are
   found in PATH.

   For shared library (DLL):

        nmake -f Makefile.msvc DLL=1 MFLAGS=-MD

   For static library:

        nmake -f Makefile.msvc

   If you want to build both the shared and static library, you have to
   unpack the gettext sources twice in different directories. Don't mix
   the two formats; you cannot use the autosprintf.h generated for the static
   library together with the shared library or vice versa.

- Installation:

   Either:

        Copy autosprintf.h to your header file repository.
        Copy asprintf.lib to your library repository.
        If you built for shared library, also copy asprintf.dll into one of
        the directories listed in your PATH, or into the directory containing
        the executable which shall make use of autosprintf.

   Or:

        nmake -f Makefile.msvc DLL=1 MFLAGS=-MD install prefix=InstallBaseDirectory
   or
        nmake -f Makefile.msvc install prefix=InstallBaseDirectory
