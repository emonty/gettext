Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Update lib/ with some files from fetish utils.

- Update other files from libtool-1.3.5 and autoconf-2.13.

- Restore lib/vasprintf.c.

- For gcc: Making the .pot files is maintainer mode; otherwise building
  breaks for normal users which don't have all the source.

- Respect the GNU standard targets in intl/Makefile.in and po/Makefile.in.in.

- gettextize needs not copy intl/ChangeLog.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Document that gettext requires the LC_MESSAGES category (or LANGUAGE
  override) and LC_CTYPE category to be set correctly via setlocale.

- Merge clisp specific changes.

- Update documentation for plural features and bind_textdomain_codeset.

- Treatment of plurals in pot-files: Use the following pattern:
    msgid "a piece of cake"
    msgid_plural "%d pieces of cake"
    msgstr0 "un morceau de gateau"
    msgstr1 "%d morceaux de gateau"
  or possibly:
    msgid "a piece of cake"
    msgid_plural "%d pieces of cake"
    msgstr[0] "un morceau de gateau"
    msgstr[1] "%d morceaux de gateau"

- Work towards integration with automake.

- Stop documenting AM_WITH_NLS. AM_GNU_GETTEXT is the right macro to use.

- Unify intlh.inst.in and libgettext.h.

- What about gettext_noop? Kill it or maybe apply this:

   2000-03-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>
     * libgettext.h (gettext_noop): Do not parenthesize Str in the
     definiens, as that breaks string literal concatenation.

   /* For automatical extraction of messages sometimes no real
      translation is needed.  Instead the string itself is the result.
      Do not parenthesize Str in the definiens,
      as that breaks string literal concatenation.  */
  #define gettext_noop(Str) Str

- Build also libintl.so, using libtool.

- Check the *.m4 macros with bleeding-edge autoconf & automake.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Read Francois Pinard's gettext folder.

- Evaluate Francois Pinard's po-utils and xpot. Takeover? Merge? Refer to?

- Change bug report address to bug-gettext instead of bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org

- install locale.alias from intl/, using a refcount mechanism like for
  charset.alias

- Split xgettext into a language dependent part and a language independent
  part.

Future:

- Remove support for catgets and Solaris gettext.
