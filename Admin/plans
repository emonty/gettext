Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Merge changes from glibc CVS, but keep the copyright as GPL.

- Merge iconv support.

- Replace bash specific INSTALL with the generic one.

- Deal with the ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am differently.

- Update lib/ with some files from fetish utils.

- Update other files from libtool-1.3.5 and autoconf-2.13.

- Restore lib/vasprintf.c.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Document that gettext requires the LC_MESSAGES and LC_CTYPE categories
  to be set correctly via setlocale.

- Make sure put-ABOUT file and Admin/ directories are not distributed.

- Should gettext.alias be distributed?

- Update documentation for plural features and bind_textdomain_codeset.

- Treatment of plurals in pot-files: Use the following pattern:
    msgid "a piece of cake" | "%d pieces of cake"
    msgstr "un morceau de gateau" | "%d morceaux de gateau" [ | more strings ]

- Work towards integration with automake.
