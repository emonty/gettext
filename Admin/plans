Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Look at Christian Robottom Reis's manual:
  http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/gettext.html

- KBabel:
  http://i18n.kde.org/translation-howto/gui-specialized-apps.html
  http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/

- Tool to help people to correct msgid strings:
  1. Program to move msgstr contents to msgid contents,
  2. Program to update the translations accordingly, much like msgmerge.

- Refer also to the GNOME translation project http://www.klid.dk/gnome/ ?

- Mention Qt linguist (part of Qt 3)

- Easier delivery of PO directory for maintainer! Add a target for incoming
  PO files

- Qt 3.0 compatibility:
  - .ts, .qph catalogs
  - .qm binary catalogs

- Add logging to libintl, in order to catch each of these problems:
>         - if the directory that was argument to bindtextdomain is usable
>         - what catalogs are installed there
>         - if the language , that is requested by LC_ALL or some other
>                 variable is really there ...
>         - if program tries to translate some message, it doesn't really know 
>                 if it really get translated ... And if requested more than 
>                 one language , you have no way to realize into what
>                 language, it had been really translated !!!!!!!

- msgdiff

- automake integration: Add to "make dist" an invocation of
  "intltool-update --maintain", parametrized through a few variables that
  specify
    - where to look for i18n files,
    - which file types are to be considered by i18n,
    - which files are explicitly not i18n (e.g. generated files like
      src/po-gram-gen.c)

- AC_SUBST([CONFIG_STATUS_DEPENDENCIES], ['$(top_srcdir)/version.sh'])

- Generating sr@latin PO file automatically from sr.po.

- XLIFF support

- object-oriented locale datatype, similar to giulia/glocale

- automatic download at installation time of PO files that have been
  provided by the translators after the official release.

- Conversion of compendia from/to TMX format.

- Support some of the conversions found in the translate-toolkit package, see
    http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/nonpo

- Extend gettextize and autopoint so that they work with several PO file
  directories. (2 votes)

- xgettext should have a simpler way to specify the --flags.

- man page pgettext.3

- po-mode.el: Editing of msgstr[i] plural forms, and setting of formula.

- The recode-* programs and msggrep should ignore the accelerator char
  transparently.
  a word is divided by shortcut symbol (like "Raści_ahni") that will be
  converted incorrectly (like "Расьці_агні", not "Расьц_ягні")
