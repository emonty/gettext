Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Update lib/ with some files from fetish utils.

- Update other files from libtool-1.3.5 and autoconf-2.13.

- Restore lib/vasprintf.c.

- Remove the distinction between localedir and gnulocaledir.

- gettextize needs not copy intl/ChangeLog.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Document that gettext requires the LC_MESSAGES category (or LANGUAGE
  override) and LC_CTYPE category to be set correctly via setlocale.

- Marc Espie's wishlist:
  Makefile.in.in that ships with the most recent release
  of gettext suffers from various defects:
  - it does not work with separate compilation, as it creates files 
    in $(srcdir) and not in $(buildir). Reading this file, somebody must
    be confused about what's maintainer-dependent, and what's build-dependent.
  - it has needless dependencies on gnu-makes, which are trivial to fix.
  - it has bogus file readability tests, which should be executability tests.

- Make sure Admin/ directory is not distributed.

- Update documentation for plural features and bind_textdomain_codeset.

- Treatment of plurals in pot-files: Use the following pattern:
    msgid "a piece of cake"
    msgid_plural "%d pieces of cake"
    msgstr0 "un morceau de gateau"
    msgstr1 "%d morceaux de gateau"
  or possibly:
    msgid "a piece of cake"
    msgid_plural "%d pieces of cake"
    msgstr[0] "un morceau de gateau"
    msgstr[1] "%d morceaux de gateau"

- Work towards integration with automake.

- Stop documenting AM_WITH_NLS. AM_GNU_GETTEXT is the right macro to use.

- Unify intlh.inst.in and libgettext.h.

- Build also libintl.so, using libtool.

- Check the *.m4 macros with bleeding-edge autoconf & automake.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Read Francois Pinard's gettext folder.

- Evaluate Francois Pinard's po-utils and xpot. Takeover? Merge? Refer to?

- Change bug report address to bug-gettext instead of bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org

Future:

- Remove support for catgets and Solaris gettext.
