Things we plan to do. Comments welcome.

- Document bash-2.04's $"..." facility and the associated 2 environment
  variables.

- Merge clisp specific changes.

- Documentation: Distinguish more clearly between gettext/xgettext,
  the Translation Project for GNU packages, and the PO mode.

- Read Francois Pinard's gettext folder.

- KDE wants a kind of gettext2("role","msg")  function whose key is the
  concatenation of "role" and "msg" but whose default value is only "msg".

- Look at Christian Robottom Reis's manual:
  http://www.async.com.br/~kiko/gettext.html

- Check whether ../lib/libsupport.a @@INTLLIBS@@ @@LIBS@@ is sufficient (see
  gettext.texi:5083) on HP-UX 10.01 and other systems lacking alloca.

- KBabel:
  http://i18n.kde.org/translation-howto/gui-specialized-apps.html
  http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/

- Rewrite doc node "Compendium", discuss functionality, then check
  implementation and add Karl's new tests.

- Tool to help people to correct msgid strings:
  1. Program to move msgstr contents to msgid contents,
  2. Program to update the translations accordingly, much like msgmerge.

- Rewrite Hundhammer's check_po script in C using message.h.

- Check portability of coding-system-list, apparently not defined
  in XEmacs 20.4.

- Refer also to the GNOME translation project http://www.klid.dk/gnome/ ?
