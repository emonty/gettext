Tests for config.rpath and lib-link.m4.

rpath-1 w
        |
        +---- a = static, b = shared

rpath-2 u v w
        | | |
        | | +---- a = static/static, b = static/shared,
        | |       c = shared/static, d = shared/shared.
        | |
        | +------ a = all libraries and the program have the same prefix,
        |         b = the libraries are in different directories.
        |
        +-------- a = all shared libraries use the libtool *.la files for
                  resolving dependencies, b = dependencies are given as
                  AC_LIB_LINKFLAGS argument instead.

The rpath-2* tests are sensitive to
  - incomplete shared library in the system,
  - bugs in libtool that creates the shared libraries,
  - bugs in lib-link.m4.

Known failures:

* FreeBSD4: rpath-2bad, rpath-2bbd fail because of a combination of a bug
  in libtool (the libtool command line for creating librpathy.la contains
  a -rpath command, but the resulting gcc command line doesn't) and a bug
  in FreeBSD's runtime loader (it searches for librpathx.so.0 twice, and
  in the second search it not only ignores the success in the first search
  but also the rpath given in the executable).
