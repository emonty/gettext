The rpath-2* tests are sensitive to
  - incomplete shared library support in the system,
  - bugs in libtool that creates the shared libraries,
  - bugs in lib-link.m4.

The rpath-3* tests are sensitive to
  - incomplete shared library support in the system,
  - bugs in libtool that creates the shared libraries.

Known failures:

* On all platforms supporting shared libraries,
    rpath-3aae rpath-3aag
    rpath-3abe rpath-3abg
  fail. This is a libtool 1.4.2 bug: When a shared library depends on a
  static library indirectly through two different dependency paths,
  libtool attempts to link together invalid sets of object files.

* OSF/1 4.0: rpath-2bbd fails, because -rpath options are not cumulative:
  The last -rpath option overrides all previous ones. One would need to
  pass all directories, separated by colons, in a single -rpath option.
