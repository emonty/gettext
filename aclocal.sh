# This script is a work-alike of `aclocal' contained in the GNU automake
# package. It is needed because our aclocal.m4 must be generated from the
# non-gettext .m4 files in /usr/share/aclocal and from the gettext specific
# .m4 files in the local m4 directory.
# With   "aclocal --acdir=m4"
# we get an error: macro `AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE' not found in library
# With   "aclocal -I m4"
# we get an error: duplicated macro `AM_GNU_GETTEXT'
# The solution is to put all the .m4 files into a temporary directory.
