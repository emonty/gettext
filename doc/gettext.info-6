How to use `gettext' in GUI programs
------------------------------------

   One place where the `gettext' functions, if used normally, have big
problems is within programs with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  The
problem is that many of the strings which have to be translated are very
short.  They have to appear in pull-down menus which restricts the
length.  But strings which are not containing entire sentences or at
least large fragments of a sentence may appear in more than one
situation in the program but might have different translations.  This is
especially true for the one-word strings which are frequently used in
GUI programs.

   As a consequence many people say that the `gettext' approach is
wrong and instead `catgets' should be used which indeed does not have
this problem.  But there is a very simple and powerful method to handle
these kind of problems with the `gettext' functions.

As as example consider the following fictional situation.  A GUI program
has a menu bar with the following entries:

     +------------+------------+--------------------------------------+
     | File       | Printer    |                                      |
     +------------+------------+--------------------------------------+
     | Open     | | Select   |
     | New      | | Open     |
     +----------+ | Connect  |
                  +----------+

   To have the strings `File', `Printer', `Open', `New', `Select', and
`Connect' translated there has to be at some point in the code a call
to a function of the `gettext' family.  But in two places the string
passed into the function would be `Open'.  The translations might not
be the same and therefore we are in the dilemma described above.

   One solution to this problem is to artificially enlengthen the
strings to make them unambiguous.  But what would the program do if no
translation is available?  The enlengthened string is not what should be
printed.  So we should use a little bit modified version of the
functions.

   To enlengthen the strings a uniform method should be used.  E.g., in
the example above the strings could be chosen as

     Menu|File
     Menu|Printer
     Menu|File|Open
     Menu|File|New
     Menu|Printer|Select
     Menu|Printer|Open
     Menu|Printer|Connect

   Now all the strings are different and if now instead of `gettext'
the following little wrapper function is used, everything works just
fine:

       char *
       sgettext (const char *msgid)
       {
         char *msgval = gettext (msgid);
         if (msgval == msgid)
           msgval = strrchr (msgid, '|') + 1;
         return msgval;
       }

   What this little function does is to recognize the case when no
translation is available.  This can be done very efficiently by a
pointer comparison since the return value is the input value.  If there
is no translation we know that the input string is in the format we used
for the Menu entries and therefore contains a `|' character.  We simply
search for the last occurrence of this character and return a pointer
to the character following it.  That's it!

   If one now consistently uses the enlengthened string form and
replaces the `gettext' calls with calls to `sgettext' (this is normally
limited to very few places in the GUI implementation) then it is
possible to produce a program which can be internationalized.

   The other `gettext' functions (`dgettext', `dcgettext' and the
`ngettext' equivalents) can and should have corresponding functions as
well which look almost identical, except for the parameters and the
call to the underlying function.

   Now there is of course the question why such functions do not exist
in the GNU gettext package?  There are two parts of the answer to this
question.

   * They are easy to write and therefore can be provided by the
     project they are used in.  This is not an answer by itself and
     must be seen together with the second part which is:

   * There is no way the gettext package can contain a version which
     can work everywhere.  The problem is the selection of the
     character to separate the prefix from the actual string in the
     enlenghtened string.  The examples above used `|' which is a quite
     good choice because it resembles a notation frequently used in
     this context and it also is a character not often used in message
     strings.

     But what if the character is used in message strings?  Or if the
     chose character is not available in the character set on the
     machine one compiles (e.g., `|' is not required to exist for
     ISO C; this is why the `iso646.h' file exists in ISO C programming
     environments).

   There is only one more comment to be said.  The wrapper function
above requires that the translations strings are not enlengthened
themselves.  This is only logical.  There is no need to disambiguate
the strings (since they are never used as keys for a search) and one
also saves quite some memory and disk space by doing this.

Optimization of the *gettext functions
--------------------------------------

   At this point of the discussion we should talk about an advantage of
the GNU `gettext' implementation.  Some readers might have pointed out
that an internationalized program might have a poor performance if some
string has to be translated in an inner loop.  While this is unavoidable
when the string varies from one run of the loop to the other it is
simply a waste of time when the string is always the same.  Take the
following example:

     {
       while (...)
         {
           puts (gettext ("Hello world"));
         }
     }

When the locale selection does not change between two runs the resulting
string is always the same.  One way to use this is:

     {
       str = gettext ("Hello world");
       while (...)
         {
           puts (str);
         }
     }

But this solution is not usable in all situation (e.g. when the locale
selection changes) nor does it lead to legible code.

   For this reason, GNU `gettext' caches previous translation results.
When the same translation is requested twice, with no new message
catalogs being loaded in between, `gettext' will, the second time, find
the result through a single cache lookup.

Comparing the Two Interfaces
============================

   The following discussion is perhaps a little bit colored.  As said
above we implemented GNU `gettext' following the Uniforum proposal and
this surely has its reasons.  But it should show how we came to this
decision.

   First we take a look at the developing process.  When we write an
application using NLS provided by `gettext' we proceed as always.  Only
when we come to a string which might be seen by the users and thus has
to be translated we use `gettext("...")' instead of `"..."'.  At the
beginning of each source file (or in a central header file) we define

     #define gettext(String) (String)

   Even this definition can be avoided when the system supports the
`gettext' function in its C library.  When we compile this code the
result is the same as if no NLS code is used.  When  you take a look at
the GNU `gettext' code you will see that we use `_("...")' instead of
`gettext("...")'.  This reduces the number of additional characters per
translatable string to _3_ (in words: three).

   When now a production version of the program is needed we simply
replace the definition

     #define _(String) (String)

by

     #include <libintl.h>
     #define _(String) gettext (String)

Additionally we run the program `xgettext' on all source code file
which contain translatable strings and that's it: we have a running
program which does not depend on translations to be available, but which
can use any that becomes available.

   The same procedure can be done for the `gettext_noop' invocations
(*note Special cases::).  One usually defines `gettext_noop' as a no-op
macro.  So you should consider the following code for your project:

     #define gettext_noop(String) String
     #define N_(String) gettext_noop (String)

   `N_' is a short form similar to `_'.  The `Makefile' in the `po/'
directory of GNU `gettext' knows by default both of the mentioned short
forms so you are invited to follow this proposal for your own ease.

   Now to `catgets'.  The main problem is the work for the programmer.
Every time he comes to a translatable string he has to define a number
(or a symbolic constant) which has also be defined in the message
catalog file.  He also has to take care for duplicate entries,
duplicate message IDs etc.  If he wants to have the same quality in the
message catalog as the GNU `gettext' program provides he also has to
put the descriptive comments for the strings and the location in all
source code files in the message catalog.  This is nearly a Mission:
Impossible.

   But there are also some points people might call advantages speaking
for `catgets'.  If you have a single word in a string and this string
is used in different contexts it is likely that in one or the other
language the word has different translations.  Example:

     printf ("%s: %d", gettext ("number"), number_of_errors)
     
     printf ("you should see %d %s", number_count,
             number_count == 1 ? gettext ("number") : gettext ("numbers"))

   Here we have to translate two times the string `"number"'.  Even if
you do not speak a language beside English it might be possible to
recognize that the two words have a different meaning.  In German the
first appearance has to be translated to `"Anzahl"' and the second to
`"Zahl"'.

   Now you can say that this example is really esoteric.  And you are
right!  This is exactly how we felt about this problem and decide that
it does not weight that much.  The solution for the above problem could
be very easy:

     printf ("%s %d", gettext ("number:"), number_of_errors)
     
     printf (number_count == 1 ? gettext ("you should see %d number")
                               : gettext ("you should see %d numbers"),
             number_count)

   We believe that we can solve all conflicts with this method.  If it
is difficult one can also consider changing one of the conflicting
string a little bit.  But it is not impossible to overcome.

   `catgets' allows same original entry to have different translations,
but `gettext' has another, scalable approach for solving ambiguities of
this kind: *Note Ambiguities::.

Using libintl.a in own programs
===============================

   Starting with version 0.9.4 the library `libintl.h' should be
self-contained.  I.e., you can use it in your own programs without
providing additional functions.  The `Makefile' will put the header and
the library in directories selected using the `$(prefix)'.

Being a `gettext' grok
======================

   To fully exploit the functionality of the GNU `gettext' library it
is surely helpful to read the source code.  But for those who don't want
to spend that much time in reading the (sometimes complicated) code here
is a list comments:

   * Changing the language at runtime

     For interactive programs it might be useful to offer a selection
     of the used language at runtime.  To understand how to do this one
     need to know how the used language is determined while executing
     the `gettext' function.  The method which is presented here only
     works correctly with the GNU implementation of the `gettext'
     functions.

     In the function `dcgettext' at every call the current setting of
     the highest priority environment variable is determined and used.
     Highest priority means here the following list with decreasing
     priority:

       1. `LANGUAGE'

       2. `LC_ALL'

       3. `LC_xxx', according to selected locale

       4. `LANG'

     Afterwards the path is constructed using the found value and the
     translation file is loaded if available.

     What is now when the value for, say, `LANGUAGE' changes.  According
     to the process explained above the new value of this variable is
     found as soon as the `dcgettext' function is called.  But this
     also means the (perhaps) different message catalog file is loaded.
     In other words: the used language is changed.

     But there is one little hook.  The code for gcc-2.7.0 and up
     provides some optimization.  This optimization normally prevents
     the calling of the `dcgettext' function as long as no new catalog
     is loaded.  But if `dcgettext' is not called the program also
     cannot find the `LANGUAGE' variable be changed (*note Optimized
     gettext::).  A solution for this is very easy.  Include the
     following code in the language switching function.

            /* Change language.  */
            setenv ("LANGUAGE", "fr", 1);
          
            /* Make change known.  */
            {
              extern int  _nl_msg_cat_cntr;
              ++_nl_msg_cat_cntr;
            }

     The variable `_nl_msg_cat_cntr' is defined in `loadmsgcat.c'.  You
     don't need to know what this is for. But it can be used to detect
     whether a `gettext' implementation is GNU gettext and not non-GNU
     system's native gettext implementation.

Temporary - Two Possible Implementations
----------------------------------------

   There are two competing methods for language independent messages:
the X/Open `catgets' method, and the Uniforum `gettext' method.  The
`catgets' method indexes messages by integers; the `gettext' method
indexes them by their English translations.  The `catgets' method has
been around longer and is supported by more vendors.  The `gettext'
method is supported by Sun, and it has been heard that the COSE
multi-vendor initiative is supporting it.  Neither method is a POSIX
standard; the POSIX.1 committee had a lot of disagreement in this area.

   Neither one is in the POSIX standard.  There was much disagreement
in the POSIX.1 committee about using the `gettext' routines vs.
`catgets' (XPG).  In the end the committee couldn't agree on anything,
so no messaging system was included as part of the standard.  I believe
the informative annex of the standard includes the XPG3 messaging
interfaces, "...as an example of a messaging system that has been
implemented..."

   They were very careful not to say anywhere that you should use one
set of interfaces over the other.  For more on this topic please see
the Programming for Internationalization FAQ.

Temporary - About `catgets'
---------------------------

   There have been a few discussions of late on the use of `catgets' as
a base.  I think it important to present both sides of the argument and
hence am opting to play devil's advocate for a little bit.

   I'll not deny the fact that `catgets' could have been designed a lot
better.  It currently has quite a number of limitations and these have
already been pointed out.

   However there is a great deal to be said for consistency and
standardization.  A common recurring problem when writing Unix software
is the myriad portability problems across Unix platforms.  It seems as
if every Unix vendor had a look at the operating system and found parts
they could improve upon.  Undoubtedly, these modifications are probably
innovative and solve real problems.  However, software developers have
a hard time keeping up with all these changes across so many platforms.

   And this has prompted the Unix vendors to begin to standardize their
systems.  Hence the impetus for Spec1170.  Every major Unix vendor has
committed to supporting this standard and every Unix software developer
waits with glee the day they can write software to this standard and
simply recompile (without having to use autoconf) across different
platforms.

   As I understand it, Spec1170 is roughly based upon version 4 of the
X/Open Portability Guidelines (XPG4).  Because `catgets' and friends
are defined in XPG4, I'm led to believe that `catgets' is a part of
Spec1170 and hence will become a standardized component of all Unix
systems.

Temporary - Why a single implementation
---------------------------------------

   Now it seems kind of wasteful to me to have two different systems
installed for accessing message catalogs.  If we do want to remedy
`catgets' deficiencies why don't we try to expand `catgets' (in a
compatible manner) rather than implement an entirely new system.
Otherwise, we'll end up with two message catalog access systems
installed with an operating system - one set of routines for packages
using GNU `gettext' for their internationalization, and another set of
routines (catgets) for all other software.  Bloated?

   Supposing another catalog access system is implemented.  Which do we
recommend?  At least for Linux, we need to attract as many software
developers as possible.  Hence we need to make it as easy for them to
port their software as possible.  Which means supporting `catgets'.  We
will be implementing the `libintl' code within our `libc', but does
this mean we also have to incorporate another message catalog access
scheme within our `libc' as well?  And what about people who are going
to be using the `libintl' + non-`catgets' routines.  When they port
their software to other platforms, they're now going to have to include
the front-end (`libintl') code plus the back-end code (the non-`catgets'
access routines) with their software instead of just including the
`libintl' code with their software.

   Message catalog support is however only the tip of the iceberg.
What about the data for the other locale categories.  They also have a
number of deficiencies.  Are we going to abandon them as well and
develop another duplicate set of routines (should `libintl' expand
beyond message catalog support)?

   Like many parts of Unix that can be improved upon, we're stuck with
balancing compatibility with the past with useful improvements and
innovations for the future.

Temporary - Notes
-----------------

   X/Open agreed very late on the standard form so that many
implementations differ from the final form.  Both of my system (old
Linux catgets and Ultrix-4) have a strange variation.

   OK.  After incorporating the last changes I have to spend some time
on making the GNU/Linux `libc' `gettext' functions.  So in future
Solaris is not the only system having `gettext'.

Introduction 0
==============

   Free software is going international!  The Translation Project is a
way to get maintainers, translators and users all together, so free
software will gradually become able to speak many native languages.

   The GNU `gettext' tool set contains _everything_ maintainers need
for internationalizing their packages for messages.  It also contains
quite useful tools for helping translators at localizing messages to
their native language, once a package has already been
internationalized.

   To achieve the Translation Project, we need many interested people
who like their own language and write it well, and who are also able to
synergize with other translators speaking the same language.  If you'd
like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, please send mail
to your translating team.

   Each team has its own mailing list, courtesy of Linux International.
You may reach your translating team at the address `LL@li.org',
replacing LL by the two-letter ISO 639 code for your language.
Language codes are _not_ the same as country codes given in ISO 3166.
The following translating teams exist:

     Chinese `zh', Czech `cs', Danish `da', Dutch `nl', Esperanto `eo',
     Finnish `fi', French `fr', Irish `ga', German `de', Greek `el',
     Italian `it', Japanese `ja', Indonesian `in', Norwegian `no',
     Polish `pl', Portuguese `pt', Russian `ru', Spanish `es', Swedish
     `sv' and Turkish `tr'.

For example, you may reach the Chinese translating team by writing to
`zh@li.org'.  When you become a member of the translating team for your
own language, you may subscribe to its list.  For example, Swedish
people can send a message to `sv-request@li.org', having this message
body:

     subscribe

   Keep in mind that team members should be interested in _working_ at
translations, or at solving translational difficulties, rather than
merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and you want to
start one, please write to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca'; you will
then reach the coordinator for all translator teams.

   A handful of GNU packages have already been adapted and provided
with message translations for several languages.  Translation teams
have begun to organize, using these packages as a starting point.  But
there are many more packages and many languages for which we have no
volunteer translators.  If you would like to volunteer to work at
translating messages, please send mail to
`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' indicating what language(s) you can work
on.

Introduction 1
==============

   This is now official, GNU is going international!  Here is the
announcement submitted for the January 1995 GNU Bulletin:

     A handful of GNU packages have already been adapted and provided
     with message translations for several languages.  Translation
     teams have begun to organize, using these packages as a starting
     point.  But there are many more packages and many languages for
     which we have no volunteer translators.  If you'd like to
     volunteer to work at translating messages, please send mail to
     `translation@iro.umontreal.ca' indicating what language(s) you can
     work on.

   This document should answer many questions for those who are curious
about the process or would like to contribute.  Please at least skim
over it, hoping to cut down a little of the high volume of e-mail
generated by this collective effort towards internationalization of
free software.

   Most free programming which is widely shared is done in English, and
currently, English is used as the main communicating language between
national communities collaborating to free software.  This very document
is written in English.  This will not change in the foreseeable future.

   However, there is a strong appetite from national communities for
having more software able to write using national language and habits,
and there is an on-going effort to modify free software in such a way
that it becomes able to do so.  The experiments driven so far raised an
enthusiastic response from pretesters, so we believe that
internationalization of free software is dedicated to succeed.

   For suggestion clarifications, additions or corrections to this
document, please e-mail to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca'.

Discussions
===========

   Facing this internationalization effort, a few users expressed their
concerns.  Some of these doubts are presented and discussed, here.

   * Smaller groups

     Some languages are not spoken by a very large number of people, so
     people speaking them sometimes consider that there may not be all
     that much demand such versions of free software packages.
     Moreover, many people being _into computers_, in some countries,
     generally seem to prefer English versions of their software.

     On the other end, people might enjoy their own language a lot, and
     be very motivated at providing to themselves the pleasure of
     having their beloved free software speaking their mother tongue.
     They do themselves a personal favor, and do not pay that much
     attention to the number of people beneficiating of their work.

   * Misinterpretation

     Other users are shy to push forward their own language, seeing in
     this some kind of misplaced propaganda.  Someone thought there
     must be some users of the language over the networks pestering
     other people with it.

     But any spoken language is worth localization, because there are
     people behind the language for whom the language is important and
     dear to their hearts.

   * Odd translations

     The biggest problem is to find the right translations so that
     everybody can understand the messages.  Translations are usually a
     little odd.  Some people get used to English, to the extent they
     may find translations into their own language "rather pushy,
     obnoxious and sometimes even hilarious."  As a French speaking
     man, I have the experience of those instruction manuals for goods,
     so poorly translated in French in Korea or Taiwan...

     The fact is that we sometimes have to create a kind of national
     computer culture, and this is not easy without the collaboration of
     many people liking their mother tongue.  This is why translations
     are better achieved by people knowing and loving their own
     language, and ready to work together at improving the results they
     obtain.

   * Dependencies over the GPL or LGPL

     Some people wonder if using GNU `gettext' necessarily brings their
     package under the protective wing of the GNU General Public
     License or the GNU Library General Public License, when they do
     not want to make their program free, or want other kinds of
     freedom.  The simplest answer is "normally not".

     The GNU `gettext' library, i.e. the contents of `libintl', is
     covered by the GNU Library General Public License.  The rest of
     the GNU `gettext' package is covered by the GNU General Public
     License.

     The mere marking of localizable strings in a package, or
     conditional inclusion of a few lines for initialization, is not
     really including GPL'ed or LGPL'ed code.  However, since the
     localization routines in `libintl' are under the LGPL, the LGPL
     needs to be considered.  It gives the right to distribute the
     complete unmodified source of `libintl' even with non-free
     programs.  It also gives the right to use `libintl' as a shared
     library, even for non-free programs.  But it gives the right to
     use `libintl' as a static library or to incorporate `libintl' into
     another library only to free software.

Organization
============

   On a larger scale, the true solution would be to organize some kind
of fairly precise set up in which volunteers could participate.  I gave
some thought to this idea lately, and realize there will be some touchy
points.  I thought of writing to Richard Stallman to launch such a
project, but feel it might be good to shake out the ideas between
ourselves first.  Most probably that Linux International has some
experience in the field already, or would like to orchestrate the
volunteer work, maybe.  Food for thought, in any case!

   I guess we have to setup something early, somehow, that will help
many possible contributors of the same language to interlock and avoid
work duplication, and further be put in contact for solving together
problems particular to their tongue (in most languages, there are many
difficulties peculiar to translating technical English).  My Swedish
contributor acknowledged these difficulties, and I'm well aware of them
for French.

   This is surely not a technical issue, but we should manage so the
effort of locale contributors be maximally useful, despite the national
team layer interface between contributors and maintainers.

   The Translation Project needs some setup for coordinating language
coordinators.  Localizing evolving programs will surely become a
permanent and continuous activity in the free software community, once
well started.  The setup should be minimally completed and tested
before GNU `gettext' becomes an official reality.  The e-mail address
`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' has been setup for receiving offers from
volunteers and general e-mail on these topics.  This address reaches
the Translation Project coordinator.

Central Coordination
--------------------

   I also think GNU will need sooner than it thinks, that someone setup
a way to organize and coordinate these groups.  Some kind of group of
groups.  My opinion is that it would be good that GNU delegates this
task to a small group of collaborating volunteers, shortly.  Perhaps in
`gnu.announce' a list of this national committee's can be published.

   My role as coordinator would simply be to refer to Ulrich any German
speaking volunteer interested to localization of free software
packages, and maybe helping national groups to initially organize,
while maintaining national registries for until national groups are
ready to take over.  In fact, the coordinator should ease volunteers to
get in contact with one another for creating national teams, which
should then select one coordinator per language, or country
(regionalized language).  If well done, the coordination should be
useful without being an overwhelming task, the time to put delegations
in place.

National Teams
--------------

   I suggest we look for volunteer coordinators/editors for individual
languages.  These people will scan contributions of translation files
for various programs, for their own languages, and will ensure high and
uniform standards of diction.

   From my current experience with other people in these days, those who
provide localizations are very enthusiastic about the process, and are
more interested in the localization process than in the program they
localize, and want to do many programs, not just one.  This seems to
confirm that having a coordinator/editor for each language is a good
idea.

   We need to choose someone who is good at writing clear and concise
prose in the language in question.  That is hard--we can't check it
ourselves.  So we need to ask a few people to judge each others'
writing and select the one who is best.

   I announce my prerelease to a few dozen people, and you would not
believe all the discussions it generated already.  I shudder to think
what will happen when this will be launched, for true, officially,
world wide.  Who am I to arbitrate between two Czekolsovak users
contradicting each other, for example?

   I assume that your German is not much better than my French so that
I would not be able to judge about these formulations.  What I would
suggest is that for each language there is a group for people who
maintain the PO files and judge about changes.  I suspect there will be
cultural differences between how such groups of people will behave.
Some will have relaxed ways, reach consensus easily, and have anyone of
the group relate to the maintainers, while others will fight to death,
organize heavy administrations up to national standards, and use strict
channels.

   The German team is putting out a good example.  Right now, they are
maybe half a dozen people revising translations of each other and
discussing the linguistic issues.  I do not even have all the names.
Ulrich Drepper is taking care of coordinating the German team.  He
subscribed to all my pretest lists, so I do not even have to warn him
specifically of incoming releases.

   I'm sure, that is a good idea to get teams for each language working
on translations. That will make the translations better and more
consistent.

Sub-Cultures
............

   Taking French for example, there are a few sub-cultures around
computers which developed diverging vocabularies.  Picking volunteers
here and there without addressing this problem in an organized way,
soon in the project, might produce a distasteful mix of
internationalized programs, and possibly trigger endless quarrels among
those who really care.

   Keeping some kind of unity in the way French localization of
internationalized programs is achieved is a difficult (and delicate)
job.  Knowing the latin character of French people (:-), if we take this
the wrong way, we could end up nowhere, or spoil a lot of energies.
Maybe we should begin to address this problem seriously _before_ GNU
`gettext' become officially published.  And I suspect that this means
soon!

Organizational Ideas
....................

   I expect the next big changes after the official release.  Please
note that I use the German translation of the short GPL message.  We
need to set a few good examples before the localization goes out for
true in the free software community.  Here are a few points to discuss:

   * Each group should have one FTP server (at least one master).

   * The files on the server should reflect the latest version (of
     course!) and it should also contain a RCS directory with the
     corresponding archives (I don't have this now).

   * There should also be a ChangeLog file (this is more useful than the
     RCS archive but can be generated automatically from the later by
     Emacs).

   * A "core group" should judge about questionable changes (for now
     this group consists solely by me but I ask some others
     occasionally; this also seems to work).

Mailing Lists
-------------

   If we get any inquiries about GNU `gettext', send them on to:

     `translation@iro.umontreal.ca'

   The `*-pretest' lists are quite useful to me, maybe the idea could
be generalized to many GNU, and non-GNU packages.  But each maintainer
his/her way!

   Franc,ois, we have a mechanism in place here at `gnu.ai.mit.edu' to
track teams, support mailing lists for them and log members.  We have a
slight preference that you use it.  If this is OK with you, I can get
you clued in.

   Things are changing!  A few years ago, when Daniel Fekete and I
asked for a mailing list for GNU localization, nested at the FSF, we
were politely invited to organize it anywhere else, and so did we.  For
communicating with my pretesters, I later made a handful of mailing
lists located at iro.umontreal.ca and administrated by `majordomo'.
These lists have been _very_ dependable so far...

   I suspect that the German team will organize itself a mailing list
located in Germany, and so forth for other countries.  But before they
organize for true, it could surely be useful to offer mailing lists
located at the FSF to each national team.  So yes, please explain me
how I should proceed to create and handle them.

   We should create temporary mailing lists, one per country, to help
people organize.  Temporary, because once regrouped and structured, it
would be fair the volunteers from country bring back _their_ list in
there and manage it as they want.  My feeling is that, in the long run,
each team should run its own list, from within their country.  There
also should be some central list to which all teams could subscribe as
they see fit, as long as each team is represented in it.

Information Flow
================

   There will surely be some discussion about this messages after the
packages are finally released.  If people now send you some proposals
for better messages, how do you proceed?  Jim, please note that right
now, as I put forward nearly a dozen of localizable programs, I receive
both the translations and the coordination concerns about them.

   If I put one of my things to pretest, Ulrich receives the
announcement and passes it on to the German team, who make last minute
revisions.  Then he submits the translation files to me _as the
maintainer_.  For free packages I do not maintain, I would not even
hear about it.  This scheme could be made to work for the whole
Translation Project, I think.  For security reasons, maybe Ulrich
(national coordinators, in fact) should update central registry kept at
the Translation Project (Jim, me, or Len's recruits) once in a while.

   In December/January, I was aggressively ready to internationalize
all of GNU, giving myself the duty of one small GNU package per week or
so, taking many weeks or months for bigger packages.  But it does not
work this way.  I first did all the things I'm responsible for.  I've
nothing against some missionary work on other maintainers, but I'm also
loosing a lot of energy over it--same debates over again.

   And when the first localized packages are released we'll get a lot of
responses about ugly translations :-).  Surely, and we need to have
beforehand a fairly good idea about how to handle the information flow
between the national teams and the package maintainers.

   Please start saving somewhere a quick history of each PO file.  I
know for sure that the file format will change, allowing for comments.
It would be nice that each file has a kind of log, and references for
those who want to submit comments or gripes, or otherwise contribute.
I sent a proposal for a fast and flexible format, but it is not
receiving acceptance yet by the GNU deciders.  I'll tell you when I
have more information about this.

The Maintainer's View
*********************

   The maintainer of a package has many responsibilities.  One of them
is ensuring that the package will install easily on many platforms, and
that the magic we described earlier (*note Users::) will work for
installers and end users.

   Of course, there are many possible ways by which GNU `gettext' might
be integrated in a distribution, and this chapter does not cover them
in all generality.  Instead, it details one possible approach which is
especially adequate for many free software distributions following GNU
standards, or even better, Gnits standards, because GNU `gettext' is
purposely for helping the internationalization of the whole GNU
project, and as many other good free packages as possible.  So, the
maintainer's view presented here presumes that the package already has
a `configure.in' file and uses GNU Autoconf.

   Nevertheless, GNU `gettext' may surely be useful for free packages
not following GNU standards and conventions, but the maintainers of such
packages might have to show imagination and initiative in organizing
their distributions so `gettext' work for them in all situations.
There are surely many, out there.

   Even if `gettext' methods are now stabilizing, slight adjustments
might be needed between successive `gettext' versions, so you should
ideally revise this chapter in subsequent releases, looking for changes.

Flat or Non-Flat Directory Structures
=====================================

   Some free software packages are distributed as `tar' files which
unpack in a single directory, these are said to be "flat" distributions.
Other free software packages have a one level hierarchy of
subdirectories, using for example a subdirectory named `doc/' for the
Texinfo manual and man pages, another called `lib/' for holding
functions meant to replace or complement C libraries, and a
subdirectory `src/' for holding the proper sources for the package.
These other distributions are said to be "non-flat".

   We cannot say much about flat distributions.  A flat directory
structure has the disadvantage of increasing the difficulty of updating
to a new version of GNU `gettext'.  Also, if you have many PO files,
this could somewhat pollute your single directory.  Also, GNU
`gettext''s libintl sources consist of C sources, shell scripts, `sed'
scripts and complicated Makefile rules, which don't fit well into an
existing flat structure.  For these reasons, we recommend to use
non-flat approach in this case as well.

   Maybe because GNU `gettext' itself has a non-flat structure, we have
more experience with this approach, and this is what will be described
in the remaining of this chapter.  Some maintainers might use this as
an opportunity to unflatten their package structure.

Prerequisite Works
==================

   There are some works which are required for using GNU `gettext' in
one of your package.  These works have some kind of generality that
escape the point by point descriptions used in the remainder of this
chapter.  So, we describe them here.

   * Before attempting to use `gettextize' you should install some
     other packages first.  Ensure that recent versions of GNU `m4',
     GNU Autoconf and GNU `gettext' are already installed at your site,
     and if not, proceed to do this first.  If you get to install these
     things, beware that GNU `m4' must be fully installed before GNU
     Autoconf is even _configured_.

     To further ease the task of a package maintainer the `automake'
     package was designed and implemented.  GNU `gettext' now uses this
     tool and the `Makefile's in the `intl/' and `po/' therefore know
     about all the goals necessary for using `automake' and `libintl'
     in one project.

     Those four packages are only needed by you, as a maintainer; the
     installers of your own package and end users do not really need
     any of GNU `m4', GNU Autoconf, GNU `gettext', or GNU `automake'
     for successfully installing and running your package, with messages
     properly translated.  But this is not completely true if you
     provide internationalized shell scripts within your own package:
     GNU `gettext' shall then be installed at the user site if the end
     users want to see the translation of shell script messages.

   * Your package should use Autoconf and have a `configure.in' or
     `configure.ac' file.  If it does not, you have to learn how.  The
     Autoconf documentation is quite well written, it is a good idea
     that you print it and get familiar with it.

   * Your C sources should have already been modified according to
     instructions given earlier in this manual.  *Note Sources::.

   * Your `po/' directory should receive all PO files submitted to you
     by the translator teams, each having `LL.po' as a name.  This is
     not usually easy to get translation work done before your package
     gets internationalized and available!  Since the cycle has to
     start somewhere, the easiest for the maintainer is to start with
     absolutely no PO files, and wait until various translator teams
     get interested in your package, and submit PO files.


   It is worth adding here a few words about how the maintainer should
ideally behave with PO files submissions.  As a maintainer, your role is
to authenticate the origin of the submission as being the representative
of the appropriate translating teams of the Translation Project (forward
the submission to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca' in case of doubt), to
ensure that the PO file format is not severely broken and does not
prevent successful installation, and for the rest, to merely put these
PO files in `po/' for distribution.

   As a maintainer, you do not have to take on your shoulders the
responsibility of checking if the translations are adequate or
complete, and should avoid diving into linguistic matters.  Translation
teams drive themselves and are fully responsible of their linguistic
choices for the Translation Project.  Keep in mind that translator
teams are _not_ driven by maintainers.  You can help by carefully
redirecting all communications and reports from users about linguistic
matters to the appropriate translation team, or explain users how to
reach or join their team.  The simplest might be to send them the
`ABOUT-NLS' file.

   Maintainers should _never ever_ apply PO file bug reports
themselves, short-cutting translation teams.  If some translator has
difficulty to get some of her points through her team, it should not be
an option for her to directly negotiate translations with maintainers.
Teams ought to settle their problems themselves, if any.  If you, as a
maintainer, ever think there is a real problem with a team, please
never try to _solve_ a team's problem on your own.
