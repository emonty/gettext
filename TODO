This is simply a loose collection of things I think future versions
should have/provide.  If you have further suggestions please tell me.

* documentation, documentation, documentation ...

* use UTF encoding for distributions

* programs should know about different character sets

* make xgettext understand other languages beside C/C++: Shell scripts,
  Perl, Tcl?, Scheme, ELisp, AWK
