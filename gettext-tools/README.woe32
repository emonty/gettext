Installation on Woe32 (WinNT/2000/XP, Win95/98/ME):

- Requires MS Visual C/C++ 4.0 or 5.0 or 6.0 or 7.0.

- Cannot build in a separate directory.

- Build instructions:

   Make sure that the MSVC4.0 or MSVC5.0 or MSVC6.0 or MSVC7.0 utilities
   ("cl" etc.) are found in PATH. In a typical MSVC6.0 installation, this
   can be achieved by running
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\bin\vcvars32.bat
   In a typical MSVC7.0 installation, it can be achieved by running
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\VC7\bin\vcvars32.bat

   For shared library (DLL):

        nmake -f Makefile.msvc DLL=1 MFLAGS=-MD

   For static library:

        nmake -f Makefile.msvc

   If you want to build both the shared and static library, you have to
   unpack the gettext sources twice in different directories. Don't mix
   the two formats; you cannot use the libintl.h generated for the static
   library together with the shared library or vice versa.

- Installation:

        nmake -f Makefile.msvc DLL=1 MFLAGS=-MD install PREFIX=InstallBaseDirectory
   or
        nmake -f Makefile.msvc install PREFIX=InstallBaseDirectory
